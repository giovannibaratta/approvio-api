      description: |
        Creates an encrypted challenge that must be signed by the agent to obtain a token.

        **Challenge Format (Server → Agent):**
        The server generates a challenge encrypted with the agent's public key. When decrypted and base64 decoded, it contains a JSON object with:
        - `audience`: string (agent name)
        - `expires_at`: ISO 8601 formatted date-time string
        - `issuer`: string (the name of the SaaS platform, e.g., "Approvio")
        - `nonce`: a random string to ensure uniqueness (the actual challenge)

  /auth/agents/token:
    post:
      summary: Exchange JWT assertion for access token
      description: |
        Validates a JWT assertion and returns a JWT access token for the authenticated agent using OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer profile (RFC 7523).

        **JWT Assertion Requirements:**
        The agent must create and sign a JWT assertion with their private key containing:
        - `iss` (issuer): Agent name
        - `sub` (subject): Agent name (same as issuer for client authentication)
        - `aud` (audience): Authorization server identifier 
        - `exp` (expiration): JWT expiration time (Unix timestamp)
        - `jti` (JWT ID): Unique nonce from the server's challenge (prevents replay attacks)
        - `iat` (issued at): JWT issued time (Unix timestamp, optional)

        **Security Notes:**
        - JWT must be signed with RS256 algorithm using the agent's private key
        - Server verifies signature using agent's registered public key
        - Each challenge nonce can only be used once (replay protection)
        - Agent identity is extracted from the JWT issuer claim
